  shortDescription: Manage OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) backup and restore operations
  description: |
    kubectl-oadp is a kubectl plugin for managing OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) backup and restore operations.
    
    It provides both admin and non-admin commands:
    - Admin commands: Full OADP/Velero backup and restore operations
    - Non-admin commands: Namespace-scoped backup operations with automatic namespace detection
    
    The plugin automatically detects the appropriate namespace from your current kubectl context
    for non-admin operations, following the principle of least privilege.
    
    Features:
    - Create and manage OADP backups
    - View backup status and logs  
    - Delete backups
    - Support for both cluster-admin and namespace-scoped operations
    - Integration with kubectl context for namespace detection
  caveats: |
    This plugin requires:
    - OADP operator to be installed in the cluster
    - Appropriate RBAC permissions for the operations you want to perform
    - For non-admin operations: namespace-scoped permissions in your current kubectl context namespace
